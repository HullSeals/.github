Who are the CyberSeals?

The CyberSeals are the technology and development wing of the Hull Seals. Similar to the TechRats of our friends the Fuel Rats, they are responsible for research, development, and support of the various Hull Seals systems. The CyberSeals are key figures in setting up the infrastructure the Seals will rely on for years to come down the road.
